## Why I'm Writing This

I've launched on Product Hunt three times so far. Same builder, same platform. But three vastly different products—and wildly different outcomes.

This post is about what actually changed between those launches. Spoiler: it wasn't the quality of the product.

## The Three Product Hunt Launches I've Been Part Of

My first PH launch was back in 2015. I was one of three cofounders at an early-stage startup. We had a small but motivated team, a shared network to tap into, and the nervous energy of people who genuinely believed in what we were building. We finished at a respectable #12.

Four years later, I did my second launch. This time, I was an employee at a 10-member VC-backed startup. We had marketing support, a Slack channel full of people ready to upvote and comment, and the kind of social proof that comes from having raised money. We broke into the top #5.

And now, seven years later, I launched [PurrPilot](https://purrpilot.com)—an app I built over a holiday break. No cofounders. No marketing team. Just me, my cats, and an extremely niche idea.

It started at #20. Every few minutes, I watched it slide down. At one point it dropped past #60. It finally landed at #53.

## What Actually Changed

Here's what was different across those three launches:

**Distribution surface area.** In the first two launches, we had multiple people sharing the link across their own networks. This time, I was the only node. My reach was my reach—nothing more.

**Number of people actively promoting.** A team of 3 or 10 people all posting, commenting, and nudging their contacts creates compounding momentum. Solo, you're fighting gravity alone.

**Early comment velocity.** Product Hunt's algorithm loves early engagement. Comments in the first hour matter more than comments in hour five. With a team, you can orchestrate that. Alone, you're hoping strangers show up.

**Verified user presence.** Upvotes from accounts with history carry more weight. In a startup, you naturally know more people who've used PH before. My personal network skews differently.

**Social proof in the first few hours.** When people see a product already trending, they're more likely to engage. When it's sitting at #45, fewer people click.

## What Product Hunt Really Optimizes For

After three launches, I've come to understand what PH actually rewards:

**Early momentum over long-term quality.** The algorithm cares about velocity, not staying power. A burst of engagement in the first few hours matters more than sustained interest.

**People, not products.** If you have a large, engaged following, your product will do well. If you don't, it probably won't—regardless of how good it is.

**Comments and discussion, not just votes.** A product with 50 upvotes and 30 comments will often outrank one with 100 upvotes and 5 comments. Engagement signals matter.

**Existing networks compounding each other.** When your cofounder shares and their network engages, that triggers more visibility, which triggers more engagement. Solo founders don't get that flywheel.

## Why This Is Especially Hard as a Solo Founder

When you're building alone, you are the only distribution node. There's no internal Slack channel to mobilize. No cofounder posting to their Twitter followers. No brand inertia from previous launches or press coverage.

You're starting from zero every single time. And on a platform that rewards momentum, starting from zero is a significant handicap.

This isn't a complaint—it's just physics. Distribution compounds. When you're one person, there's nothing to compound.

## What Launch-Day Attention Also Attracts

Within hours of launching, my inbox filled up with messages from strangers offering to "boost" my product. Fake amplification services. SEO and backlink sellers. "We'll get you to #1" marketers.

This happens regardless of how your product is doing. It happens regardless of quality or traction. These people prey on founders when they're most vulnerable—when they're refreshing the leaderboard every few minutes, watching their rank slip, wondering if they should've done something differently.

I ignored all of them. But I understand why some founders don't.

## What I Got Wrong Going In

I made a few mistakes in how I approached this launch:

**Expecting effort to translate to rank.** I'd put real work into PurrPilot. I assumed that would count for something. It doesn't. Product Hunt doesn't measure effort—it measures distribution.

**Refreshing the leaderboard too much.** Every few minutes, I'd check. Every drop felt personal. This was a waste of emotional energy.

**Treating launch day as a verdict.** I caught myself thinking, "If this doesn't do well, maybe the idea isn't good." That's wrong. Launch-day performance measures your distribution, not your product's value.

## What Product Hunt Is Still Good For (Even If You Finish #53)

Despite the ranking, I don't regret launching. Here's why:

**Forcing yourself to ship.** Having a launch date on the calendar made me finish. Without it, I might still be tweaking the app in private.

**External validation from strangers.** A few people I've never met found PurrPilot through the launch and reached out. That signal—people outside my network finding value—matters more than any leaderboard position.

**A canonical launch URL.** I now have a page I can point to that says "this product exists, it launched, here's what it does." That's useful for credibility, even if the numbers aren't impressive.

**Long-tail credibility, not launch-day success.** Product Hunt pages stick around. People will find PurrPilot through search long after launch day is forgotten.

## Advice to Solo Founders Planning a PH Launch

If you're building alone and considering a Product Hunt launch, here's what I'd tell you:

**Define success before launch day.** Decide what a "good" outcome looks like before you're in the emotional chaos of watching numbers move. For me, success was shipping and learning—not ranking.

**Do not anchor your self-worth to ranking.** Your position on the leaderboard reflects your distribution network, not the quality of your work or your worth as a builder.

**Optimize for learning, not leaderboard position.** Pay attention to who engages, what questions they ask, what resonates. That's the real value of launching publicly.

**Treat PH as a distribution experiment.** It's one channel among many. It's not a verdict on your product or your future.

## Why I'd Still Do This Launch Again

I shipped something real. An app that solves a problem I actually have. That alone makes it worth it.

I learned how distribution actually works—not in theory, but by watching it play out in real time. I now have cleaner signal about what matters and what doesn't.

Most importantly: I'm building for users, not for Product Hunt. The people who need an app to plan road trips with their cats will find it. The leaderboard was never going to be my primary acquisition channel anyway.

Finishing #53 stung for about a day. And then I started planning the next feature.
